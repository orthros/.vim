# .vim
My .vim dotfiles and configurations

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following installed:

* vim (of course!)
* make (to do the install)
* git (for the submodules)
* curl 

To use these run:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/orthros/.vim.git vim
$ cd vim
$ make install
```

This will create symlinks in the appropriate directories!
